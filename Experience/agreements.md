# Agreements

An agreement is a shared agreement that is non-violable. Unlike practices, they are not aspirational. They present a firm and clear boundary on how we choose to be with each other.

It's best to strive to keep agreements to a minimum for a few reasons: agreements are the most “expensive” agreements to change, often requiring the most work to revise or scrap. They’re also pretty reactionary and limit our ability to creatively problem solve and respond to new situations, eventually creating more challenges than they solve. Also, we live in a litigious culture that attempt to 'legislate co-operation'. Rule-creep can lead to a culture that externalizes common sense to a set of complicated policies instead of relying on relationships, and a shared vision to work/learn together.


## Sovereignty

We respect each other's sovereignty, autonomy and dignity. We don't coerce, boss, threaten, punish, give consequences, bribe, reward or praise to get what we want. Instead, we focus on creating the type of connection where everyone's needs get met. We remember our own free choice.

## No Fault Zone

When someone breaks an agreement, it’s because they forgot or are disconnected from themselves. We don’t blame, shame, or give consequences. Instead, we remind them and help them connect with their hearts.


## Confidentiality

- Meetings are private. Who is in it is private. Your experience is not. 
Every man must agree to absolute confidentiality. The Vegas Principle applies: what goes on in the group, stays in the group. 
● This is even more essential when men within the group are also friends socially. 
● What you may share about Men’s Group with family and friends: 
●The intentions of Men’s Group 
●The structure and format of Men’s Group 
●Personal insights gained from Men’s Group 



# The Three Agreements: Integrity, Kindness, and Whole Heartedness

We have three agreements that guide our actions. We expect every person to uphold these agreements every day.


## The first agreement: Integrity
In simplest form, this means being honest. One way to embody integrity is "doing the right thing even when no one is watching." 

At Dev Bootcamp, we are asking you to do a crazy thing: to learn how to be a web developer within a matter of weeks.  For you to reach this goal, we need everyone to work together, follow our methodology, and agree to adhere to the rules and guidelines that have made Dev Bootcamp be successful. 

At Dev Bootcamp, we have codes of conduct that support an optimal learning environment and ensure that everyone gets the most out of the program.  We expect you to be in integrity with:
- Showing up on time
- Working through the curriculum each week
- Communicating with your accountability group and Phase 0 staff when you are struggling
- Pairing with others
- Asking for help
- Submitting and rating feedback
- Posting and responding to questions on the community
- Going through the entire process outlined in each challenge

Part of being in integrity also means that when you fall out of it for whatever reason (such as being a human being) you own up to it.  Most of the time all it takes is an acknowledgment of being out of integrity and everybody can move on.

## The second agreement: Kindness
We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice;" they are actually not the same thing. Being kind does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate, but it does not preclude giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is <strong>A</strong>ctionable, <strong>S</strong>pecific, and <strong>K</strong>ind (ASK). 

We expect all of you and staff to show kindness by providing feedback and code reviews to one another, informing one another when someone has fallen out of integrity, and by bringing ourselves 100% into each challenge every day. We also show kindness through showing respect to others and our space. 

Last but not least, we expect you to be kind to yourself.  You've taken a big risk and are making a big change.  Give yourself some space and understanding as you face the challenges of our program. 

## The third agreement: Whole Heartedness

> The antidote to exhaustion is not necessarily rest? The antidote to exhaustion is wholeheartedness. ~ David Whyte

This may be the most straight-forward agreement. In essence, we expect you to bring your whole self (your intelligence, focus, creativity, and personality) into each challenge every day. This means that we expect you to do your best to meet each learning competency. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (including staff) for help.

We expect everyone to complete the assigned challenges, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing the challenge if nothing is learned. The DBC experience is fundamentally about *learning*. We expect you to demonstrate effort and mastery of each learning competency by completing the challenges. 

***

Not meeting these agreements are grounds for being asked to leave the program (at any phase). 

We will send periodic updates to those of you who have not submitted your work, missed a Guided Pairing Session (GPS), or have fallen out of integrity in other ways. These emails are not meant to shame. Rather, we simply want to remind you of your agreement to come to DBC in integrity, with kindness, and with effort everyday. We want to give everyone the opportunity to meet these agreements. 

However, we recognize that life happens which can make it impossible to complete every challenge. In these situations, it's vital that you communicate with staff regularly to create a personal action plan that will get you on back on track.  At Dev Bootcamp, we hold a very high bar to measure your success and we expect that you leverage all the supports we provide to help you get there - teachers, tutors and your fellow cohort mates.

## Gift

Our presense is a gift. Given freely and without expectation of reward, financial or otherwise. No commerce. 

## Radical Inclusion

Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.

Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value. In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.


Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.


## Don't proselathise

No politics or religion. Don't convert or convince anyone. Ask don't demand. Offer don't sell. 

----

Team First: Staying connected is more important than anything else. We do it first, last and always. When we lose connection we reopen our heart tunnels as soon as we can and reconnect.
Free Will:  We respect each other's sovereignty, autonomy and dignity. We don't coerce, boss, threaten, punish, give consequences, bribe, reward or praise to get what we want. Instead, we focus on creating the type of connection where everyone's needs get met. We remember our own free choice. 
Responsibility: We take responsibility for our own needs, feelings, and actions. We do our best to meet our own needs. When we can’t, we ask for support from others. 
Cooperation: We do our best to meet each other’s needs out of generosity. We look for opportunities to love and serve each other, our friends and family, and anyone else who needs us. We take care of our home together.
Kindness: We respect each other’s space, things, privacy, opinions and boundaries. We don’t yell, hit, threaten, force, call names or tease. We listen.
Truth: We tell the truth and keep our word. We quickly address broken agreements and repair as soon as possible.
Resisting Addiction: Sugar, screens and shopping feel good. We do them sometimes, and we help each other not get addicted. Instead of sugar, we try to choose fruit or cuddles. Instead of screen we choose reading or playing. Instead of shopping we create or trade. 
Joyful Stuff: We want to have a light impact on mother earth, and a home without clutter. We take care of our things and only acquire what is useful or bring us joy.
No-Fault Zone: When someone breaks an agreement, it’s because they forgot or are disconnected from themselves. We don’t blame, shame, or give consequences. Instead, we remind them and help them connect with their hearts.
Cuddling: Whenever we have the chance, we cuddle.
