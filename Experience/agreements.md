# Agreements

An agreement is a shared agreement that is non-violable. Unlike practices, they are not aspirational. They present a firm and clear boundary on how we choose to be with each other.

It's best to strive to keep agreements to a minimum for a few reasons: agreements are the most “expensive” agreements to change, often requiring the most work to revise or scrap. They’re also pretty reactionary and limit our ability to creatively problem solve and respond to new situations, eventually creating more challenges than they solve. Also, we live in a litigious culture that attempt to 'legislate co-operation'. Rule-creep can lead to a culture that externalizes common sense to a set of complicated policies instead of relying on relationships, and a shared vision to work/learn together.


## Sovereignty

We respect each other's sovereignty, autonomy and dignity. We don't coerce, boss, threaten, punish, give consequences, bribe, reward or praise to get what we want. Instead, we focus on creating the type of connection where everyone's needs get met. We remember our own free choice.

## No Fault Zone

When someone breaks an agreement, it’s because they forgot or are disconnected from themselves. We don’t blame, shame, or give consequences. Instead, we remind them and help them connect with their hearts.


## Confidentiality

- Meetings are private. Who is in it is private. Your experience is not. 
Every man must agree to absolute confidentiality. The Vegas Principle applies: what goes on in the group, stays in the group. This is even more essential when men within the group are also friends socially. 

What you may share about Father's Group with family and friends: 
- The intentions of Father's Group 
- The structure and format of Father's Group 
- Personal insights and experiences gained from Father's Group 

## Integrity
In simplest form, this means being honest. One way to embody integrity is "doing the right thing even when no one is watching." 

Integrity involves

- Showing up on time
- Working through the curriculum each week
- Coming to the group with full presence and a clear mind (no drug or alcohol use)
- Posting and responding to questions on the community
- Attending all scheduled meetings. If there is some unforeseen emergency, letting the group know via text.
- Taking care of yourself. Speaking up if you need something.

Part of being in integrity also means that when you fall out of it for whatever reason (such as being a human being) you own up to it.  Most of the time all it takes is an acknowledgment of being out of integrity and everybody can move on.

## Kindness
We expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice;" they are actually not the same thing. Being kind does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate, but it does not preclude giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is <strong>A</strong>ctionable, <strong>S</strong>pecific, and <strong>K</strong>ind (ASK). 

Last but not least, we expect you to be kind to yourself.  You've taken a big risk and are making a big change.  Give yourself some space and understanding as you face the challenges of our program. 

## Whole Heartedness

> The antidote to exhaustion is not necessarily rest? The antidote to exhaustion is wholeheartedness. ~ David Whyte

This may be the most straight-forward agreement. In essence, we expect you to bring your whole self (your intelligence, focus, creativity, and personality) to the group. 

Finding your edge and live there. Ask for help if you need it. Challenge yourself and the men to bring it. You will get out of this group what you put in. Give your gift fully. Live at the edge of your generosity. 

## Radical Inclusion

Anyone father be a part of a father's group. We welcome and respect the stranger. No other prerequisites exist for participation in our community. 

## Don't proselathise

No politics or religion. Don't convert or convince anyone. Ask don't demand. Offer don't sell.
