## Leaving the Group

Leaving the group 
We have had situations where men have requested to leave the group, and situations where we have had to ask men to leave the group. In the same way as there is a process for entering the group, so too there should be a process for exiting the group. It can be an empowering or disempowering process for the man leaving and for the group. Following a process will maintain the integrity of the group and that of the men within it as well as the integrity of the man leaving. 
Reasons why men want to leave 
● Life circumstances change meaning they cannot commit to regular attendance. 
● They may no longer be committed to the intentions or the structure of the group 
● They may be confronted by the intentions or the structure or indeed by particular men within the group. 
Reasons to ask a man to leave 
● They are unable to commit to regular attendance 
● They are not able to share effectively or give effective feedback. In other words, they do not contribute to the growth of the other men and/or are unable to be contributed to. 
● As the group is a forum for growth and development, if a man does not exhibit a capacity to enable changes to occur in his life then the intention of the group is no longer being fulfilled. For example, a man is coached continuously about a specific change he wants to make in his relationship. Despite the feedback, he continues to have the same issues arise session after session without exhibiting any commitment to change. If he is unable to shift this then he is wasting his time and more importantly, the groups time. Either he stops bringing the issue to the group, or he needs to leave. 

How to make it a win-win 
● Men do not enter a Men’s Group lightly or unconsciously, so men should not exit from Men’s Group in this way either. A man should not exit Men’s Group in a way which leaves either themselves or the other men ‘incomplete’. Everything that needs to be said should be said. This does not mean everyone needs to be happy about the decision, but whether they are happy with or not, they have had an opportunity to express themselves. 
● Any man who wishes to leave the group must give prior notice via email that the next session will be his last, or if he gives notice on the night, the next session will be his last. 
● Any group that wishes a man to leave must have reached consensus on the decision (see our definition on ‘consensus’). A representative from the group (usually the man who invited him or the ‘leader’ of the group) must call the man and let him know the thoughts of the group. Ideally, it should not come as a complete surprise to the man; he should have received feedback previously from the group regarding the issues around why he is now being asked to leave. 


How to conduct the final meeting 
● The man leaving should be given the opportunity to attend a final session with the group so that he can say his farewells and anything else that needs to be shared. 
● Should he wish, the man leaving can attend the whole session, or he can be the first to share, receive final feedback, and then leave. 
Follow up 
● The man who leaves Men’s Group should receive a follow-up email after his final session thanking them for participating in the group and wishing them the best for their future. If they have been the ones who asked to leave, let them know they are always welcome back. 
● Any man who leaves should receive a follow-up email or call from the group 3 months after they have left. Just a check-in.
