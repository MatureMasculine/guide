# Logistics for in Person Fathers Groups

## Number of men Our 

Father's Group has functioned effectively with 9 men. An attendance of 6-8 is usually ideal, with a minimum of 4 men to be effective. 

## The ideal physical space 

- Chairs should ideally be all at the same height and placed in a circle, preferably with nothing in the middle of the circle. 
- Sitting on the ground is ok, as long as men have a cushion or something to slightly elevate them from the ground to be able to maintain a reasonable posture throughout. 

## Children and partners/housemates 
- While we have had meetings where there was a baby sleeping upstairs, or a partner in another section of the house, it is really not ideal to have anyone else in the house/space. 

## Tea and refreshments 
- Food can be a disruption to the flow of the meeting and to a man who is sharing, so if men want to come early or stay afterward for food, that’s fine, but not during the meeting. 
- Tea and water are fine during the meeting. However should only be consumed in between the shares, not whilst a man is sharing or giving feedback. Tea should be prepared before the initial meditation. 

## Where and when to meet 

- Public locations are not appropriate, so meet in a location that is quiet and that won’t be disrupted. 
- You can meet at the same location, or rotate between men’s homes, or hire a conference room/scout hall etc. 

## Frequency 

- Some Father's Groups meet weekly, or fortnightly. There are Father's Group that meet monthly and then have a monthly teleconference in between, so effectively the conversation is still fortnightly. Anything less than every fortnight tends to be less effective. 

## Time of day 
- Some Father's Group starts at 8pm - that way, men can still have dinner with their families and not get home too late either. 
- Weekends and daytimes may also work, though consider the impact on family time – you will need their support in attending regularly. 

## Duration 
- One to Two hours - any more is exhausting, and less will be insufficient time for all to share if there is a full complement of men (7-8).
