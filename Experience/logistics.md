Number of men Our Men’s Group has functioned effectively with 9 men. We have actually rarely had all of us there at one meeting, so an attendance of 7-8 is usually ideal, with a minimum of 4 men to be effective.

The ideal physical space 
Set-up 
● Chairs should ideally be all at the same height and placed in a circle, preferably with nothing in the middle of the circle. 
● Sitting on the ground is ok, as long as men have a cushion or something to slightly elevate them from the ground to be able to maintain a reasonable posture throughout. 
Children and partners/housemates 
● Whilst we have had meetings where there was a baby sleeping upstairs, or a partner in another section of the house, it is really not ideal to have anyone else in the house/space. 
Tea and refreshments 
● Food can be a disruption to the flow of the meeting and to a man who is sharing, so if men want to come early or stay afterward for food, that’s fine, but not during the meeting. 
● Tea and water are fine during the meeting. However should only be consumed in between the shares, not whilst a man is sharing or giving feedback. Tea should be prepared before the initial meditation. 
Where and when to meet 
Location 
● Public locations are not appropriate, so meet in a location that is quiet and that won’t be disrupted. 
● You can meet at the same location, or rotate between men’s homes, or hire a conference room/scout hall etc. 
Frequency 
● Some Men’s Groups meet weekly, however our Men’s Group has always met fortnightly. There is a Men’s Group that meets monthly and then has a monthly teleconference in between, so effectively the conversation is still fortnightly. Anything less than every fortnight tends to be less effective. 
Time of day 
● Our Men’s Group starts at 8pm - that way, men can still have dinner with their families and not get home too late either. 
● Weekends and daytimes may also work, though consider the impact on family time – you will need their support in attending regularly. 
Duration 
● Two hours - any more is exhausting, and less will be insufficient time for all to share if there is a full complement of men (7-8).
