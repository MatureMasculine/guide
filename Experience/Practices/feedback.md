# Feedback 

> You should be able to trust that these friends will tell you about your life as they see it, offer you a specific action which will shed light on your own position, and give you the support necessary to live in the freedom just beyond your edge, which is not always, or even usually, comfortable.~ David Deida

# Purpose 
● To serve the man who has just shared 
● To experience the gift of serving another man 
● An offering to the man who shared that will give him an access to living a life more closely aligned with his purpose in such a way that leaves the man feeling empowered (and he may not like what he heard and it may not make him feel ‘good’) 
● To hear how others see and feel you 
Method 
● The most effective feedback does usually not take more than 30 seconds. It may simply be just one word. It is succinct and to the point. 
● If a man’s feedback extends beyond one minute, he is more than likely rambling. Others will feel themselves getting distracted and annoyed as he keeps talking. Call him on it. Just say the words “you’re rambling” or “get to the point” or “keep it succinct”. 
● Honour the experience of the man who just shared by putting yourself aside. Feedback is distinct from opinions and judgements, which usually come from your own projections. Feedback is also distinct from ‘advice’. Whilst opinions, judgements and advice may be required at times, they need to be dealt out sparingly. 
● Feel into the man. Did he share from his head or his heart? Was he in is body and breathing deeply into his balls or was he scattered and flighty? Did he maintain eye contact or was he avoiding the eyes of the other men? Did he feel trustable or un-trustable? Did he feel clear and connected to his purpose or did he feel slimy, evasive or inauthentic? 
● Be ruthlessly compassionate. Feedback is not about being nice; the aim is not to break the man but to say what needs to be said and have the balls to say it. He may not like what he hears, but he gets that the feedback is given in order to serve him. This is being ruthlessly compassionate. If a man is left with a new insight or an access to taking action, he has been served and received ruthless compassion. 
● Feedback is given lovingly – not as a bully, not to create fear or diminish the man. To deliver feedback in this way is the art of being a superior man.

Scoring of feedback Scoring of feedback is optional, but highly recommended, especially in the early days. 
● When a man has completed his feedback, the recipient of the feedback will give a score out of 10 for the feedback. 
● A ‘10’ means the man’s feedback was spot on. It meant the man giving you feedback really heard you. Ideally, the feedback clarified something for you, gave you a deeper insight, or empowered you into action. 
● Alternatively, instead of scoring each man’s feedback, the man who shared can give a “big HO” to the man who he felt gave him the most powerful feedback. 
● Scoring is the barometer of how effectively you have felt into the man who shared and a measure of whether your feedback has ‘hit the mark’ and made a difference. It is generally an indicator of how present the feedback giver was to the man who shared and to what he shared and whether he intuited beneath what was shared. 
Response to scoring 
● You may feel that your feedback has totally hit the mark. Your feedback may even be validated by similar feedback from other men in the group. However, this may or may not be reflected by the score you receive. You may think it was a ‘10’ but get a ‘2’. 
● Your score for your feedback is a measure of how your feedback was received and the state of mind of the man who has received your feedback. 
● Do not let the score diminish you or make you think that your feedback was ‘wrong’. Just used it as an opportunity to reflect on how present you were to that man and the other men in the group. 
● Similarly, observe your ego when you get a high score for your feedback. 
Passing 
● If a man feels he has nothing to add or contribute to the man who has shared then it is best that he ‘pass’ rather than speak for the sake of speaking. 
● Passing on feedback is not to be done lightly nor regularly. The man who passes on feedback needs to be clear for himself why he has opted to pass. 
● In the same vein, to say something like “I agree with what everyone else has said” is a waste of time and words. Remember that Men’s Group is a vigorous enquiry. 


Response to feedback 
● Receiving feedback is an essential element of developing the masculine. It is an access to growth. This growth is achieved by remembering why the man is giving you feedback in the first place. 
● You may not like what you hear. It may hurt. But if it does hurt, it may also contain a kernel of truth. Try it on. Breathe it in. Sometimes the person we are most blind to is ourselves. 
● Feedback is not necessarily the truth. It may be wrong. It may be way off the mark. Regardless, listen and breath it in. 
● Do not respond to feedback verbally, or defend your position. It takes something to give a man honest feedback, so acknowledge his feedback with a nod or a verbal ‘ho’, score the feedback and then move to the next man for more feedback.
