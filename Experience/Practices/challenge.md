# Challenge

A challenge is needed when you feel like there's a situation that needs to be addressed/confronted. Something is going on that needs to change/stop/improve.

## Challenge steps

There are four steps to a challenge:

1. Ask permission "Hey, I have a challenge for you, is now a good time?"
2. Briefly state what you're noticing "I noticed the last 3 projects, you got less than 40% complete on them"
3. Set a clear, time bound, actionable challenge  "I challenge you to get over 80% completeness on the next 3 projects"
4. Ask for acceptance, and be willing to hear yes, no, or to negotiate.
5. Pro step: Follow up with the person you challenged and hold them accountable.

When delivered well, a challenge feels like a gift. It feels like you are seeing my potential and inviting me to step into it. It feels like you're on my team.

## Persecutor traps

You know you’re falling into Persecutor if you find yourself:

1. Judging / Criticizing
2. Feeling bigger / better / smarter than the other
3. Reaching for rules, standards to legislate cooperation
4. Insisting that the other person accept your challenge
5. Don't feel like you're on the other person's team

Part of your feedback may include challenging the man who shared to take on an action. This can include doing something differently, or being/behaving in a different way. 
● The masculine thrives on being in action, so the idea of ‘challenges’ totally resonates with being a man in the world. 
● This is a powerful tool however it can also easily be collapsed with an expectation of how another man ‘should’ be or what he ‘should’ do; this is a judgement and thus needs to be carefully considered before being expressed.
