# Practices

Practices are ongoing and shared. We use them to deepen in our Values and uphold the [Dynamic Tensions](https://github.com/MatureMasculine/guide/tree/4d5a0462fa490f4d15010be70b252a06d0ea395e/Dyanmic_Tensions/README.md). If our Values are our North Star, the practices are the ships we sail in. They help us get there.

Our practices are aspirational. By definition, we will not do them perfectly, or consistently. Our commitment is to practice, fail, and then return again to the practice. Reminding each other when we forget, and reflecting to each other as we progress.

A practice is usually associated with a shared skill, or shared knowledge. For example, to practice **Non Judgement** as a collective there needs to be shared understanding of what judgement is and shared language around it.

## Additional Practices

Over time, members of our learning collective can and will add practices that they value and offer them to the rest of us.
