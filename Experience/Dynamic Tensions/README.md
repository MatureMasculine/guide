# Dynamic Tensions

Culture happens. It's not something we can control, but it's something we can intentionally impact. Culture is invisible and impacts us more than anything else. This guide assumes two things:

* First: Culture is critical to succeeding.
* Second: We can be intentional about co-creating it, and deliberate in evolving it together.

Everyone is responsible for embodying and improving this culture.

To do so, we need to pay attention to several dynamic group tensions, and take ownership of keeping them in balance, and navigating their ebbs and flows. 

There are 5 dynamic tensions, that make up a healthy Father's Group culture:

* [Belonging](belonging.md): Being Myself &lt;--&gt; Being in Relationship
* [Efficacy](efficacy.md): Agency &lt;--&gt; Structure
* [Flow](flow.md): Fun &lt;--&gt; Engagement
* [Growth](growth.md): Challenge &lt;--&gt; Support
* [Trust](trust.md): Truth &lt;--&gt; Safety
