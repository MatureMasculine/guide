# Selection

Males Only. 

Finding the right men Above all, men who want to be part of a Father's Group are men who are committed to the above intentions of the Father's Group. They also need to be committed to the methods and structure of the group. They are men who are committed to their own growth and development, and committed to the growth and development of other men. 

Life situations The diversity of men’s background should be encouraged: socioeconomic, cultural differences and sexual orientation should not be barriers to entry or inclusion. Our group has had single men, married men, divorced men, gay men, men with children and men with no children. A commitment to the intention, methods, and structure of the group is what is imperative. 
Friends or not friends? It is not important that the Father's Group contains men who know each other socially. In fact, whilst it is ok for this to be the case, it is probably more ideal to have men who don’t all know each other socially. Again, diversity in the make-up of the men is essential. 
You do not have to ‘like’ the men in your Father's Group. Much can be gained from having men in the group you don’t particularly like, and might never mix with socially outside of Father's Group. 
Age Men of all ages (and differing ages) can participate. Again, a commitment to the intention, methods and structure of the group is what is imperative. 
Commitment to growth Participants do not need to have attended any specific course, nor done any self-development work, though both will significantly enhance the depth of the group. 
Each man in the group will at times have life experiences that will be challenging, and this should not exclude their participation. Whilst the other men in the group will absolutely support them, Father's Group is not a ‘support group’. 
Whilst Father's Group is a supportive and therapeutic structure, it is not a ‘support group’ or ‘therapy session’ as such. If men simply want to be listened to and not be challenged, they might need to find other structures for this to occur. 
Men should seek professional advice and support external to the group, should they require it. Father's Group should not exist as a substitute for professional support. Many of the men in our group have seen or continue to see a therapist, psychologist, or coach, as an adjunct to Father's Group.

Inviting new men to the group 
A new man should receive an email / be directed to www.mensgroup.info before they begin. They should be absolutely clear about: 
1. The intentions of Father's Group - what it is and why 2. The structure of Father's Group 3. The agreements around attendance and participation. 4. The trial period (including readings) 



The trial period 
● New men will have a trial of 3 sessions. 
● On the first session of the trial, a new man may choose to share or he may simply observe the process and not share. In subsequent two sessions he must share and give feedback and partake in all activities. 
● After the trial both the group and the new man will decide if the Father's Group will serve him and if he will serve the Father's Group. 
● This should be done via email between all existing members of the group to get a consensus on the new man. 
● Consensus does not mean that all men agree, and it is different to a majority vote. Consensus means that you can live with and abide by the decision made by the majority of the group. 
● If consensus cannot be gained, then the new man may not join the group. 
● Determining whether a man is allowed to join the group should be based primarily on two things: his capacity to share (or at least his willingness to learn how to); and his capacity to give and receive feedback. 
● Once consensus is gained, one existing member should contact the new man and determine if he in fact wishes to join.
