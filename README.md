# Mature Masculine Operating System

> What we are doing here is so important, we better not take it too seriously. ~ Suzuki Roshi

## Welcome

Our learning collective is self-organizing, rigorously goal-driven, and personally rewarding. A powerful, positive culture is the strongest, most pervasive support structure a learning community can have.

As a collective each member takes on two objectives:

* **Objective 1:** To mature the masculine within myself so that I may serve life. 
* **Objective 2:** To coach and challenge other members into their mature masculine so that they may serve life. 

Our Culture OS provides a framework by which we --as members of the learning collective-- can achieve our objectives. It supports us in co-creating a culture that draws out the best in us. It defines the components of our shared culture and the processes by which members of the learning collective can shape it.

Culture happens. It's not something we can control, but it's something we can intentionally impact. Culture is invisible and impacts us more than anything else. Our Cultural Operating System assumes two things:

* First: Culture is critical to succeeding.
* Second: We can be intentional about co-creating it, and deliberate in evolving it together.

Everyone is responsible for embodying and improving this culture.
