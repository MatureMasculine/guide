> What we are doing here is so important, we better not take it too seriously. ~ Suzuki Roshi

## Intro

Since the beginning, our ancestors supported and challenged each other, in order to become who they were meant to be. 

As they learned to live a true life, they told stories to remember and pass on what they knew. 

Inside each of us, life four main Masculine Archetypes. 

King, Lover, Magician, and Warrior. 

If we want to life a full life, we must learn to baland and embody these powerful essences. 

We grow through the witnessing and mentorship of others that we respect. 

We practice seeking and offering support...

...so that we may serve life. 

## A Vessel for our boys

A coherent set of practices, language, and culture that can serve as guidance and support for our boys. 
A place where they can be witnessed, have their essense reflected back to them. Where they can find coaches and mentors. 
An counsel of elders and uncles. Fathers and grandfathers. 

A place for boys and young men to seek shelter from the forces of scattering and distraction arraigned against them. 
Where every part is welcome. Where their wildness and beauty is supported, and their deepest heart desires are reflected back to them. 

To offer our sons a set of values. 
To support them in becoming themselves. 
To call from our Fathers what we see them needing.

An intact culture of men.
