Mature Masculine Serving Life

## Mission
Supporting the masculine through ongoing support groups. Challenge and coaching the masculine into maturity. 


Men’s Group is for men who want to be challenged and want to challenge each other in being the greatest men they can be. 
● Men’s Group explores what it means to be a man and what masculine essence is: to clarify your direction and purpose; to give your gifts fully to the world; to have integrity, to know what commitment is and to be trustable; to be clear and grounded; to be strong and consistent; to be whole; and to be aligned and at peace, inwardly and outwardly. 
● Men in Men’s Group hold each other accountable to live a life at the edge; to us, this means being committed to a fulfilled life consistent with your unique purpose, and to be held accountable for what it takes to live that life. 
● Men’s Group achieves this through regular meetings of authentic sharing, rigorous feedback, and physical and spiritual practices. This all takes place in a confidential environment where it is safe to share and express freely and openly. 
● Men in Men’s Group respect and honour each other as whole and complete men who make mistakes and stuff up. Men need support in error-correcting without shutting down, hurting ourselves or hurting others. 
● While there is a serious intent to Men’s Group, their is also a commitment to have men be more light-hearted and playful in their worlds. 
● A context for social interaction and deep, authentic friendship may also arise from these meetings.
